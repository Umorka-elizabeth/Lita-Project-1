A Retail Store Sales Performance Analysis

### Project Overview
---
This project presents the sales performance of a Retail Store who sells various products. It aims to show the top selling product, total sales generated by products, sales generated by different regions, monthly sales, total revenue generated and others. We achieved this through the dataset given for 20 months of sales (January 2023 - August 2024).This analysis includes critical examination of the sales data to understand the performance of the store and to propose actionable recommendations where necessary.

### Data Description
---
The dataset includes the following fields:

1. OrderID: Unique identifier for each transaction.
2. CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer
3. Product: This is the name for each item sold
4. Region: An area of the country located for sales
5. OrderDate: Customer purchase date for each transaction in 2023 and 2024.
6. Quantity: The number of units of the product purchased in each transaction.
7. Unit Price: Price per unit of product
8. Total Sales: Total amount paid for sales transaction

### Basic Statistics about the Dataset:
1. Total Sales/Revenue: N2,101,090.00
2. Average Sales: N1,256.00
3. Product Average Sales: N212
4. Total Quantity Sold: 6846 items
5. Number of Unique Customers: 9921
6. Number of Products: 6

 ### Methodology
 ---
### Data Collection
The dataset for this analysis was provided by the Incubator Hub, Lita Data Analysis Dept. The data was provided in CSV format, making it accessible for analysis.

### Data Manipulation
1. Data Cleaning:
Checked for Spelling Errors, Duplicate Values, and Blank Cells: Ensured data quality by correcting any spelling errors, removing duplicate entries, and addressing missing values.

2. Data Transformation:
Data Types and Formatting: Ensured all data fields were assigned the correct data types and well formated. New columns were added where necessary.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
---
After cleaning the data in excel, pivot table was used for the analysis and then the cleaned data was exported to Structured Query Language for futher analysis and finaly to PowerBi for the creation of interactive dashboard. The following activities were carried out;
* Data Filtering and Segmentation: Filtering was done on Excel and pivot tables allows for segmentation by products, regions and monthly sales which produces a great insight into the data. SQL's GROUP, WHERE and ORDER BY clauses filtered and grouped by product, region, monthly etc also revealed targeted insight while PowerBI segmented insights of Excel and SQL into an interesting report.
* Descriptive Analysis: Metrics calculation was done on Excel for the average sales which reported N1,256.00 and the total revenue by region which reported N2,101,090.00. SQL queries were written for a futher insight of the sales data and PowerBI visualises all.
* Dashboard Creation: Pivot table on Excel was used for the summarisation of the dataset and PowerBi dashboard visualizes the data using components like barchat, piechart, table, area chart and slicer.

 ### Tools used
 ---
1. Microsoft Excel: This is used for data cleaning, analysis and creating pivot visualization
2. Structured Query Language for quering data
3. PowerBI for dashboard visualization

 ### Data Analysis and Insights Generation
 This visualization tells a lot about the Retail Store. It reveals the top selling product, sales in each region, monthly sales, top customers etc.
 
 * Total Sales by Product;
From the dashboard above, the highest sales generated by the store is from product shoes with a total sales of N613,380.00 while the lowest sales generated by the store is from product socks with a total sales of N180,785.00. Total revenue generated by the store is N2,101,090.00.

* Total Sales by Region;
Region South reported the highest revenue of N927,830.00, which is about 44% of the entire revenue while region East, North and West reported 23%, 18% and 14% respectively.

* Sales Trends
  From the dashboard, the line chart visualizes the monthly sales. We can see that February has the highest sales while April has the lowest sales in 2023 and in 2024, February still has the highest sales while July the lowest. Though we can not reach a conclusion on 2024 because the reporting period is just eight months. Sales seems to be quite impressive in some months while others need to improve in other to avoid a downward sales trend.
