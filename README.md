### Project Overview
---
This project presents the sales performance of a Retail Store who sells various products. It aims to show the top selling product, total sales generated by products, sales generated by different regions, monthly sales, total revenue generated and others. We achieved this through the dataset given for 20 months of sales (January 2023 - August 2024).This analysis includes critical examination of the sales data to understand the performance of the store and to propose actionable recommendations where necessary.

### Data Description
---
The dataset includes the following fields:

1. OrderID: Unique identifier for each transaction.
2. CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer
3. Product: This is the name for each item sold
4. Region: An area of the country located for sales
5. OrderDate: Customer purchase date for each transaction in 2023 and 2024.
6. Quantity: The number of units of the product purchased in each transaction.
7. Unit Price: Price per unit of product
8. Total Sales: Total amount paid for sales transaction

### Basic Statistics about the Dataset:
1. Total Sales/Revenue: N2,101,090.00
2. Average Sales: N1,256.00
3. Product Average Sales: N212
4. Total Quantity Sold: 6846 items
5. Number of Unique Customers: 9921
6. Number of Products: 6

 ### Methodology
 ---
### Data Collection
The dataset for this analysis was provided by the Incubator Hub, Lita Data Analysis Dept. The data was provided in CSV format, making it accessible for analysis.

### Data Manipulation
1. Data Cleaning:
Checked for Spelling Errors, Duplicate Values, and Blank Cells: Ensured data quality by correcting any spelling errors, removing duplicate entries, and addressing missing values.

2. Data Transformation:
Data Types and Formatting: Ensured all data fields were assigned the correct data types and well formated. New columns were added where necessary.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
---
After cleaning the data in excel, pivot table was used for the analysis and then the cleaned data was exported to Structured Query Language for futher analysis and finaly to PowerBi for the creation of interactive dashboard. The following activities were carried out;
* Data Filtering and Segmentation: Filtering was done on Excel and pivot tables allows for segmentation by products, regions and monthly sales which produces a great insight into the data. SQL's GROUP, WHERE and ORDER BY clauses filtered and grouped by product, region, monthly etc also revealed targeted insight while PowerBI segmented insights of Excel and SQL into an interesting report.
* Descriptive Analysis: Metrics calculation was done on Excel for the average sales which reported N1,256.00 and the total revenue by region which reported N2,101,090.00. SQL queries were written for a futher insight of the sales data and PowerBI visualises all.
* Dashboard Creation: Pivot table on Excel was used for the summarisation of the dataset and PowerBi dashboard visualizes the data using components like barchat, piechart, table, area chart and slicer.
 
 ### Data Analysis carried out on Structured Query Languag
 ---
 This is where we include some basic lines of code or queries.
 
To select the dataset table
 ```SQL
SELECT * FROM TOTAL_SALES FROM [dbo].[PROJECT 1 SALES DATA]
```
Total Sales for each product
```
SELECT PRODUCT, SUM(TOTAL_SALES) AS TOTAL_SALES FROM [dbo].[PROJECT 1 SALES DATA]
GROUP BY PRODUCT
```
Number of sales transaction in each region
```
SELECT REGION, COUNT(*) AS TOTAL_SALES FROM [dbo].[PROJECT 1 SALES DATA]
GROUP BY REGION
```
Highest selling product by total sales value
```
SELECT TOP 1 PRODUCT, SUM(TOTAL_SALES) AS TOTAL_SALES FROM[dbo].[PROJECT 1 SALES DATA]
GROUP BY PRODUCT
```
Total revenue per product
```
SELECT PRODUCT, SUM(TOTAL_SALES) AS TOTAL_SALES FROM [dbo].[PROJECT 1 SALES DATA]
GROUP BY PRODUCT
```
Monthly sales totals for the year
```
SELECT MONTH(OrderDate) AS MONTH, SUM(Total_Sales) AS MonthlySales FROM [dbo].[PROJECT 1 SALES DATA]
WHERE year (OrderDate) = year (GetDate())
Group by month(OrderDate)
Order by month;
```
Top 5 customers by total purchase amount
```
 SELECT TOP 5 customer_id, sum(Total_Sales) AS TOTALPURCHASEAMOUNT FROM [dbo].[PROJECT 1 SALES DATA]
 GROUP BY CUSTOMER_ID
 Order by TotalPurchaseAmount
desc;
```
Percentage of total sales by each region
```
SELECT Region, SUM(TOTAL_SALES) AS TOTAL_SALES, sum (Total_sales)*1.0/(select sum(Total_Sales) from [dbo].[PROJECT 1 SALES DATA])*100
As PercentageofTotalSales from [dbo].[PROJECT 1 SALES DATA]
Group By Region;
```
Products with no sales in the last quarter
```
Select Product from [dbo].[PROJECT 1 SALES DATA]
Group By Product
Having Sum(CASE WHEN OrderDate BETWEEN '2023-09-01' AND '2023-12-31'
THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0
```

 ### Tools used
 ---
1. Microsoft Excel: This is used for data cleaning, analysis and creating pivot visualization
   [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)
3. Structured Query Language for quering data
4. PowerBI for dashboard visualization

 ### Data Analysis and Insights Generation
 This visualization tells a lot about the Retail Store. It reveals the top selling product, sales in each region, monthly sales, top customers etc.
 
 * Product Performance;
The barcharts visualizes revenue generated by each product. The product with the highest revenue is Shoe which generated N613,380.00, followed by Shirt with a revenue of N485,000.00, followed by Hat with a revenue of N316,195.00, Gloves with revenue of N296,900.00, Jacket with a revenue ofN208,230.00, while the product with the lowest revenue is Socks reporting revenue of N180,785.00. Total revenue generated by the store during the year 2023 to August 2024 is N2,101,090.00.

* Regional Performance;
Region South reported the highest revenue of N927,830.00, which is about 44% of the entire revenue while region East, North and West reported N485,925.00, N387,000.00 and N300,345.00 revenue which represents 23%, 18% and 14% respectively as visualized by the Piechart.

* Sales Trends
  From the dashboard, the line chart visualizes the monthly sales. We can see that February has the highest sales while April has the lowest sales in 2023 and in 2024, February still has the highest sales while July the lowest. Though we can not reach a conclusion on 2024 because the reporting period is just eight months. Sales seems to be quite impressive in some months while others need to improve in other to avoid a downward sales trend.
  
### Recommendation
---
1. Aggresive Sales: There is need for aggressive sales of all the products in all region. From the analysis above, N2M sales for almost two years is not encouraging though product Shoe reported the highest revenue so far and the South Region reported the highest turnover as well, there is still need for sensitization of all the products especially the low generated products and region.
2. Advertisment/Marketing: To achieve the above, the store will need to embark on different marketing strategies such as the 7Ps- Pricing, Packaging, Positioning, Promotion, Place, People and Promotion. Others include, Social media marketing, content marketing, AI marketing, Advertising etc
3. Management Decision: The management of the Store needs to discover what is working and not for the store. Probably they need to do away with some old strategies and imbibe new ones.
4. Study Customers Demands: A thorough examination must be done on the demands of customers in the different regions. From the analysis above region South has the highest revenue, this shows that one or two products might have a high turnover. Other regions should be examined as well in other to meet customers demand and to boost sales in their respective locations.
5. Effective Sales Training: There should be constant seasonal training for sales personnels. This will have a postive impact on sales.

### Conclusion
---
The store performance is not bad but there is need for a great improvement. If the above recommendations can be applied, especially in the area of marketing - the 7Ps. Taking into consideration optimized pricing strategies e.g low ball pricing for a low income earners region, appropriate discount, customer satisfaction, other actionable and achievable strategies, focus on boosting sales for more revenue. Implementing these strategies aims to improve sales performance and ensure sustainable growth.
